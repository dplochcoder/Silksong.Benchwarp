# Silksong.Benchwarp

This mod ports Hollow Knight's [Benchwarp mod](https://github.com/homothetyhk/HollowKnight.BenchwarpMod) to Hollow Knight: Silksong. Among its features, Benchwarp allows:
- Using the menu to set respawn to any bench.
- Using the menu to warp to the current respawn point.
- Using the menu to warp to a transition.

Benchwarp has various modes which can be selected in the config, or from the mod menu:
- StandardBenchwarp: Only warp to visited benches.
- WarpOnly: Only warp to the current respawn.
- UnlockAll: Warp to any bench.
- Doorwarp: Warp to any door transition.

In the menu, bench status is displayed as follows:
- Yellow: current respawn.
- White: previously visited.
- Red: unvisited.
- Purple: locked (only used in integrations with other mods).

## Dependencies

- Core Silksong modding libraries: DataManager, I18N, ModMenu.

## Features
### Hotkeys
Benchwarp supports hotkeys which can be used in place of menu buttons while the game is paused. All hotkeys consist of two sequential button presses. The presses do not need to be simultaneous. There are two types of hotkey commands:
1. Letter, followed by a number: selects a bench from the menu, and warps to it (or to current respawn, if the bench is not selectable). Labels for these hotkey combinations are displayed when hotkeys are enabled.
2. A pair of letters, which executes a special command, such as:
- **LB**: **L**ast **B**ench (equivalent to just clicking Warp).
- **SB**: **S**tart **B**ench (equivalent to clicking Set Start, then Warp).
- **DW**: **D**oor **W**arp (equivalent to selecting Door Warp as the menu mode). If used while Door Warp is enabled, switches the mode to Standard Benchwarp.
- **NP**: **N**ext **P**age (equivalent to clicking the pages button).

Tip: by default, some letters such as **A** are bound to actions that can cancel the menu. To enter the hotkeys including these letters, you can move the mouse to deselect the Resume button. Alternatively, you can input the hotkey by pressing the buttons nearly simultaneously.
